                <h1>More info about me</h1>
                <p>My name is Daniel, and I'm from Ecuador. I grew up in the Galápagos Islands—an incredibly beautiful place surrounded by pristine nature and the ocean. Life there gave me a unique and unforgettable childhood filled with wonder, exploration, and deep appreciation for the natural world.
                In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the opportunity to serve a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Due to pandemic restrictions, I served within Ecuador, which turned out to be a profound and life-changing experience. Despite the global challenges, it was a time filled with spiritual growth, service, and connection with people across my own country.
                I’m currently studying at Brigham Young University–Idaho, majoring in Software Development. I’m passionate about using technology to solve meaningful problems and build tools that make life better for others. My roots in the Galápagos inspire me to think creatively and stay grounded, and my mission experience continues to shape how I connect with people and face challenges with faith and determination.
