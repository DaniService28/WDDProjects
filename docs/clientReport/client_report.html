      <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
      <p>
        Since it was a website we had to develop, I wanted to try something I hadn’t done before—something that involved more animations and interactive elements. I had everything planned out until they told us we would be working with developers on our idea. I adjusted the plan slightly but kept the original concept, mainly searching for websites that could help with animations.

      <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Were there any issues with communication?</h2>
      <p>
        We only communicated during class sessions. It would have been better to share another way to stay in touch—ideally not just email, but also a phone number or a social media account.

      <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
      <p>
        From one of the reports he gave me, I could see he understood the idea I had in mind. I haven’t seen the final version of the site yet—maybe I will soon. That said, I'm already late turning in this report, so I have to move forward with what I know.

      <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first time participating in something like this, but next time I would work much more closely with the developer. From day one, they should have access to the site link so I can monitor changes as they happen—not just at the very end.

      <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
      <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
      <p>
        In terms of developing the site itself, I didn’t really run into problems. Overall, I wouldn't say I had any major issues, but the experience could have been better if everyone had been more excited about working as a team.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
      <p>
        I tried to push myself a little by using JavaScript and giving the page some custom animation. Achieving that and realizing it wasn’t as hard as I thought felt really rewarding.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
      <p>
        I’d get to know my team better—grab their Instagram, make a group chat or something like that to have a more direct and fun way of communicating.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Besides this project, I also worked on another one using the same tools. This experience helped me realize what I could improve and which tools are more effective for projects like these. In that other project, I applied them more successfully—mostly because the team’s collaboration was stronger. Their involvement made a big difference.
