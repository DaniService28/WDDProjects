        <h2>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h2>
        <p>
            I reached out to them, shared the plan and wireframes via email, let them know I had sent the message, and then simply gave them access to the project through GitHub.

        <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Were there any issues?</h2>
        <p>
            My client initially contacted me via email—he didn’t send anything specific, just mentioned that he wanted me to be creative. After I pointed that out, he sent a second email with a general idea of what the website should cover and a very basic wireframe. Considering his original request, I designed the site my own way. I never saw him again in class, but I had already finished early this week. Yesterday, I sent him the link to the site via email.

        <h2>How did you handle publishing your client’s site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
        <p>
            I didn’t really do much.

        <section>
        <h2>How was your experience with managing your site using GitHub?</h2>
        <p>
            It was somewhat easier. I’ve seen that when multiple users make changes at the same time, the site can run into issues—but that didn’t happen here because the junior developers weren’t making updates while I was.
