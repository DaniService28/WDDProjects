        <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Were there any issues?</h2>
        <p>
            One of them reached out to me, gave me access, and had both the wireframe and client content inside the GitHub folder. He simply said, "You’ll work on this part," and that’s exactly what I did.<br>
            The other lead developer also gave me access, but I was never able to see the changes he made in GitHub, and I never saw him again in class.

        <section>
        <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
        <p>
            For one of the websites, yes—I followed the wireframe accordingly and completed it based on that.

        <section>
        <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
        <p>
            Affirmative, but only for one of the two.

        <section>
        <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
        <p>
            None. Once I began working on the subpage, I checked and saw that my teammates had already completed the other two websites. So I just finished my part, and that was it.
